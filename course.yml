title: Intro to SQL for Data Science
description: >-
  The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights.
  Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer
  transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called
  relational databases. To be an effective data scientist, you must know how to
  wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL .
  This course teaches syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, such as
  PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. This course teaches you everything
  you need to know to begin working with databases today!
